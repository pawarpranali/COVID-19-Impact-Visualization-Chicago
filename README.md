# COVID-19 Impact Visualization in Chicago

This repository contains the project files for our Data Visualization group project from the MIS 6380.002 class at The University of Texas at Dallas. The project aims to create a comprehensive visualization of the impact of COVID-19 in Chicago, focusing on the demographic inconsistency in cases, the strain on healthcare infrastructure, and the economic effects on the dining sector.

## Project Description
This project visualizes the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chicago from 2020 to 2023. Key focus areas include:
- Demographic inconsistency in COVID-19 cases
- Strain on healthcare infrastructure
- Economic effects on the dining sector

## Objectives
- Visualize the effects of COVID-19 on Chicago's older residents.
- Examine gender-based differences in COVID-19 cases.
- Illustrate the relationship between rising COVID-19 cases and healthcare pressures.
- Show the impact of COVID-19 on Chicago's restaurants.

## Summary
The project highlights critical pressures faced by healthcare providers, including the use of non-ICU beds and ventilator shortages, alongside the correlation between COVID-19 case surges and restaurant closures. We utilized MS Excel for data cleansing and Tableau for creating visualizations.

## Data Description
The dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, broken down by age, gender, and ethnicity. It also includes data on ventilator and ICU bed usage, as well as restaurant inspection results.

## Insights and Findings
- Older age groups suffered greater hospitalizations and fatalities.
- There was no significant increase in the utilization of non-ICU beds despite rising cases.
- Ventilator availability increased with rising demand, showing adaptability in healthcare.
- Higher COVID-19 case rates did not consistently result in more restaurant closures.
